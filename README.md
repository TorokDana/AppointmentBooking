# phpReference
For anywhom who is interested in a quick demo of my skills. Please keep in mind, that i'm only a university student, without any work experience.

This is only available in Hungarian at the moment.
It's a php project where you can book an appointment for getting a shot of vaccine. 
The project was made before the vaccine was a thing, so there is no option to choose from hem. 
Alter you sign up and log in, you can book an appointment by clicking on a green colored date. You can't book another one until you cancel your previous appointment.
If you log in as an admin (e-mail: admin@nemkovid.hu pwd:admin), you can add new appointments and check informations about already existing ones.
This whole project could be improved, but it's just a short demo, so you may miss things that you would want to see on a true site similar to this.
